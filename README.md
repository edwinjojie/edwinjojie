<h3 align="center">AI Engineer • Computer Vision Automation • Full-Stack Systems Developer</h3>

<p align="center">
I build intelligent systems end-to-end — from perception models and LLM-driven agents to distributed microservices and full-stack platforms.  
I’m still a student, but I engineer like someone who already builds for production.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### **Smart City Waste Disposal Detection**
A real-world computer vision deployment for detecting illegal waste disposal from CCTV streams.  
Depth reasoning, temporal classification, and structured evidence → automated city enforcement.

### **Valid8Care — AI Agent–Driven Automation Engine**
A modular multi-agent system for validating, enriching, and scoring healthcare data from PDFs, CSVs, and images.  
Built using microservices, message queues, and autonomous agent workflows.

### **DAPCVRN — Distributed Credential Verification Network**
A trust and verification infrastructure combining:  
- AI agents for credential logic  
- Blockchain anchoring for tamper resistance  
- Microservices for issuing, verifying, and revoking credentials  
- Full-stack dashboards for universities, recruiters & students
